I made this application in 2010 to help me learn songs on the piano from MIDI files. The UI is terrible but the intended functions work.
To use this app, simply select an output MIDI device and click Start. If the button changes to stop then the MIDI device is active. Next, click top left blue button, with an open book. Select the midi file which you want to play. The file plays automatically starts playing. You can increase or reduce the playing speed and watch the keys. You can also transpose upwards or downwards using the right-most blue buttons.
